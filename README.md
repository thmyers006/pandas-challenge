Hello World!

Welcome to my Python Pandas Challenge Project called PythonCitySchools.

Description: This project involved taking two data sets of schools statistics for a district.
My task was to take the data sets, merge them and then analyze the results.

The data used can be found in two csv files in the Resources folders.  
I created multiple tables based on the merged data set and those tables will generate 
when the code is run.

Findings: 
1. There are 39,170 students in this combined data set attending 15 different high schools.
2. The schools are either district schools or charter schools with populations ranging from 
  427 students up to as many as 4976 students. Observed trends: 
  A. Students at charter schools performed significantly better than students at district schools
      based on % of students passing both reading and math during the year.
  B. All 5 of the top 5 performing schools based on % of students passing both reading and math are charter schools, 
      while all 5 of the bottom 5 performing schools based on % of students passing both reading and math are district schools.
  C. In general, students across the district performed better in reading than they did in math, overall average reading scores
      are higher than overall average math scores.
  D. School spending does not account for or positively influence the percentage of students passing both math and reading.
      This is seen when the top 5 performing schools and the bottom 5 performing schools tables are compared and 'per
      student budget spending' is taken into consideration.
  E. Finally, total school population inversely affects student performance, i.e. the smaller the population, the higher
      the students' math and reading scores and the opposite is true. This relationship is shown on the final table.
